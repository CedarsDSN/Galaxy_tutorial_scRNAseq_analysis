**Primary analysis**
====================

For single-cell RNA-seq analysis, Primary analysis is the first crucial step in understanding the transcriptomic data gathered from single-cell RNA sequencing. This process involves converting raw sequencing data into a form that can be further analyzed to uncover the rich biological insights hidden within. It sets the foundation for all subsequent analyses and interpretations. Most of the Single-cell
