**Primary analysis**
====================

For single-cell RNA-seq analysis, Primary analysis is the first crucial step in understanding the transcriptomic data gathered from single-cell RNA sequencing. This process involves converting raw sequencing data into a form that can be further analyzed to uncover the rich biological insights hidden within. It sets the foundation for all subsequent analyses and interpretations. Single-cell RNA sequencing generates multiple read files, and they are labeled as R1, R2, R3 (or I1). These are the standard files produced but can vary depending on the technology and the sequencer. 

* R1 has the Barcode information
* R2 typically has the actually cDNA sequences
* I1 is typically from an illumina sequencer and will contain the Illumina lane information
