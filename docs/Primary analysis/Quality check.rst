**Quality check**
=================

We will be using FASTQC tool to conduct a quality check of our files. FastQC is designed to offer an easy method for performing quality control evaluations on raw sequencing data derived from high-throughput sequencing technologies. It features a series of modular analyses that help quickly determine if there are any significant issues with your data that you need to address before proceeding with more in-depth analysis.
