**Filter data**
===============

In the previous section, we studied each important metric for single-cell RNA-seq analysis in detail. We also looked at how each scatter plot and violin plot would look depending on which filter you use and the thresholds therein. Understanding the metrics is essential to handling your data better. No two datasets are the same, and it's important to understand your data. 

For those running the workflow, navigate to "Workflows" and then "Single-cell RNA-seq tertiary analysis" workflow and click on the "Run workflow" button

* The previous section goes into the default values of the three metrics under "Filtering by Features", "Filtering by Counts", and "Filtering by percentage of mitochondrial counts". If you would like to modify the default values according to the scatter plots for your data, use the edit button to change the Min value and Max value under each of these three headings
