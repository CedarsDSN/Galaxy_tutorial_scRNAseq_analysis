**Filter data**
===============

In the previous section, we studied each important metric for single-cell RNA-seq analysis in detail. We also looked at how each scatter plot and violin plot would look depending on which filter you use and the thresholds therein. Understanding the metrics is essential to handling your data better. No two datasets are the same, and it's important to understand your data. 

For those running the workflow, navigate to "Workflows" and then "Single-cell RNA-seq tertiary analysis" workflow

* The previous section goes into the default values of the three metrics under ""
