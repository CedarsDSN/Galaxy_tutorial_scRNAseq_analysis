**Normalize data**
==================

Normalizing single-cell data is a crucial step in single-cell analysis, aimed at removing technical noise and ensuring comparability across cells. This process typically involves adjusting for differences in library size and detecting variability across the cells. Methods such as TPM (Transcripts Per Million), CPM (Counts Per Million), and normalization using scaling factors like those from the scran package in R, help to standardize the data before downstream analyses. These normalized datasets are then used to accurately identify gene expression patterns, cellular heterogeneity, and biological signaling pathways specific to single-cell studies.
