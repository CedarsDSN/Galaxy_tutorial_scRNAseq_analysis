**Importing data from Primary Analysis**
========================================

**If you have run the Primary analysis workflow and would like to import the AnnData object file from the Primary analysis workflow and use it to conduct filtering and clustering**, use the steps below -

.. note::

  1. From your Primary analysis history, you will notice one of the results collection from "SCEasy converter" named as "AnnData object"
  2. This object holds the counts and all information from your single-cell RNA-seq samples
  3. Scroll to the top of the history, and select the settings button
  4. Under Dataset options, Click on the option "Copy Datasets"
  5. This will open a new page where you can check the box next to the dataset you want to copy to a new history. Refer to the screenshot 1 and 2 below.
  6. Select the "SCEasy converter" folder and select the "Destination history" as the history you created earlier - "Single-cell RNA-seq tertiary analysis”
  7. Now, navigate to the "Single-cell RNA-seq tertiary analysis” history and your file will be available here
  8. You don't need any other file to run this workflow. You are ready to run this workflow
