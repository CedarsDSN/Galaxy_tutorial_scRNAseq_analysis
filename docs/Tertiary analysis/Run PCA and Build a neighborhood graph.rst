**Run PCA and Build a neighborhood graph**
==========================================

rincipal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical method commonly used in data analysis to identify patterns in high-dimensional data by transforming it into a new coordinate system. In the context of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), where each cell's gene expression profile is captured, PCA plays a crucial role in reducing the dimensionality of the data while retaining most of its variability. This reduction simplifies data visualization and facilitates the identification of biologically relevant features, such as cell types or states, amidst the complexity of gene expression profiles. By condensing the information into principal components, which are orthogonal axes representing the directions of maximum variance, PCA enables researchers to uncover underlying cellular heterogeneity, identify rare cell populations, and characterize dynamic biological processes, thereby advancing our understanding of complex biological systems at the single-cell level.
