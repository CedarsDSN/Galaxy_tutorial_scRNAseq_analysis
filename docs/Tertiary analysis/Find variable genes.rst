**Find variable genes**
=======================

Identifying variable genes in single-cell data is essential for highlighting features that distinguish different cell populations. This involves statistical methods to detect genes that exhibit significant variability across cells, beyond what is expected by technical noise. Advanced computational tools like Seurat or Scanpy implement these approaches, allowing researchers to focus on genes that are likely to be biologically informative. This step is crucial for downstream analyses such as clustering and identifying cell types based on gene expression profiles.
