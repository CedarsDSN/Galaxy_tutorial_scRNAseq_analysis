**Run UMAP and tSNE**
=====================

Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) is a dimensionality reduction technique that has emerged as a powerful tool in the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Unlike traditional methods such as t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), UMAP preserves both global and local structure in the data, allowing for more accurate representation of complex biological relationships. By transforming high-dimensional gene expression profiles into a lower-dimensional space, UMAP enables visualization of cellular heterogeneity, identification of distinct cell populations, and exploration of continuous cellular trajectories. Its ability to capture non-linear relationships and preserve local neighborhood structures makes UMAP particularly well-suited for revealing subtle biological variations and dynamics within heterogeneous cell populations. Moreover, UMAP embeddings serve as a foundation for downstream analyses such as clustering, trajectory inference, and cell type identification, thus playing a crucial role in advancing our understanding of cellular heterogeneity and dynamics in diverse biological systems.
