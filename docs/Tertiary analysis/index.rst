**Tertiary analysis**
=====================

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful tool for dissecting cellular heterogeneity and uncovering novel insights into biological systems with unprecedented resolution. Tertiary analysis of scRNA-seq data, which encompasses clustering, normalization, and related techniques, plays a crucial role in transforming raw sequencing data into interpretable biological knowledge. In this article, we explore the standard workflow for tertiary analysis of scRNA-seq data, focusing on key steps such as quality control, normalization, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and cell type identification.
