**Annotate gene names in cluster file**
=======================================

As you have gone through the tutorial till this stage, you would have noticed that the gene symbols are used as the field when plotting tSNE, UMAP and PCA plots. We would prefer to have the gene names in the final cluster file for ease of use, so we don't have to go back to re-check what symbols match to which genes.
