**Find markers**
================

In single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis, identifying marker genes is a crucial step for characterizing distinct cell populations and understanding their functional roles within complex biological systems. Marker genes are those whose expression levels are significantly associated with specific cell types or states. Various statistical methods, such as differential expression analysis using algorithms like DESeq2 or edgeR, are employed to identify genes that are differentially expressed between different cell clusters or conditions. Additionally, specialized tools like SCENIC or Seurat's FindMarkers function offer tailored approaches for marker gene discovery in scRNA-seq data. Once identified, marker genes serve as signatures for defining cell types, subtypes, or states, providing insights into cellular identity, function, and regulatory networks. They are invaluable for understanding cellular heterogeneity, developmental trajectories, and disease states, thereby advancing our knowledge of complex biological processes at the single-cell level.
