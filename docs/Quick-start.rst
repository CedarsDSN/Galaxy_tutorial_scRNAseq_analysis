Quick-start
============

Primary analysis workflow (includes Primary and Secondary analysis)

This is the list of steps that one would require to run the “Single-cell RNA-seq Primary analysis” workflow without getting into too much detail about each step. To understand each step in-depth, please proceed to the next page.


1. Open Galaxy and sign in with your username and password 
2. Create a new history for this analysis and rename this history with a name that is intuitive to you
3. Next, since this is a tutorial for single-cell RNA-seq reads from 10X, the reads would look like this - 
a. pbmc_1k_v3_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz
b. pbmc_1k_v3_S1_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz
c. pbmc_1k_v3_S1_L001_I1_001.fastq.gz
