Welcome to Cedar-Sinai Medical Center Data Science Navigation team's Galaxy documentation!
=========================================================================================

In this tutorial, the user will be guided through using a workflow in the Cedars-Sinai Galaxy instance. This workflow is for Single-cell RNA-seq analysis, and covers Primary, Secondary and Tertiary analysis. In Galaxy, there are two workflows, "Single-cell RNA-seq Primary analysis" which covers Primary and secondary analysis and "Single-cell RNA-seq Tertiary analysis" which covers tertiary analysis. If you would like to access all tutorials developed for Galaxy workflows by the DSN team, it is accessible `here <https://galaxy-tutorial-landing-page.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
