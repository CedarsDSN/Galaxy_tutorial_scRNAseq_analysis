**Alignment and Quantification of reads**
=========================================

Now, that we have finished conducting the quality control. We are now ready to carry out the alignment of the reads and then quantify these reads to obtain a count matrix. We are using RNA STARsolo tool to carry out demultiplexing, alignment and quantification.
